# Packing Coloring of Subcubic Planar Graphs

Project for the FINP course at UL FMF. 

We want to find a planar subcubic graph with the packing coloring number as large as possible.

First, we will implement an ILP model to determine the packing coloring number for a given graph. Next, we will write a procedure which generates a planar subcubic graph from an existing one.

Finally, having done these two things done, we will apply as many as possible tests to obtain such a graph with the packing coloring number as large as possible.
